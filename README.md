# 3ds Max - Switch Orthographic to Perspective

Tired of 3ds Max switching to Orthographic mode for "no reason whatsoever"? Use these MAXScript to prevent the pain:

**perspective-viewport.ms:**  
Automatically switch orthographic view into perspective view.
  
**perspective-viewport-ui.ms:**  
Manually override automatic switching from orthographic view to perspective view.
  
**perspective-viewport-menu.ms:**  
Add custom user interface item to custom category to allow adding the 'Switch Orthographic to Perspective' UI to a custom toolbar.
  
Both **perspective-viewport.ms** and **perspective-viewport-ui.ms** are mandatory to be used by the user, **perspective-viewport-menu.ms** is however optionable.
  
Each file features a custom installation description inside the file under "[INSTALLATION]".
